He often heard about friend’s successes in real estate, became interested, but never bought, as it looked like it was a full time job. He then saw the true opportunity. He finally bought a house in 2008 and made a profit. Turns out, what was supposed to be the worst time to buy, turned into the best, time to buy… for Smartland®.

The restaurant operates independently with its own entrance but shares common bathrooms with the adjacent business. The neighboring lively tavern, known as Meeting House, does not serve food, which presents an opportunity for the operator to service additional patrons. Guests are greeted by a glass vestibule that leads to a spacious bar/dining counter and full-service dining room. Bi-fold windows open out to the quaint neighborhood, revealing a sizable dining patio that could run the length of the building. The offering provides several growth and expansion opportunities, including the potential to expand onto the rooftop for additional al-fresco occupancy, utilizing the sliding service window with another concept or late-night service, and expanding into the lower level kitchen space for catering and/or serving delivery ghost concepts. This is lease assignment and asset sale. Refer to the flyer for details.

The average house income in the area is $110K+!! It is also just a block away from Village Crossing Shopping Center. Another great opportunity of this area is that a huge mixed use residential complex called District 1860 will open this year at the intersection of Touhy and Lincoln Ave (only 0.6 miles away from this property). Once District 1860 is open, there will be heavier walking and car traffic at Touhy and drive more retail businesses. What about the demographic in this area?

The Pontiac Building is located on Printers Row, an area that was developed in the late 19th century by printing and publishing firms that constructed facilities near the Dearborn Street railroad station. According to the city’s historic landmark website, the area’s unusual street pattern of long narrow blocks was constructed to provide the buildings an abundance of natural light, which was necessary for engraving and typesetting.

Location Overview:
Ravenswood's history dates to the late 1800s when a real estate group developed the land to be a prime neighborhood for families and commuters--a reputation the area still holds today. Ravenswood is a local favorite nestled on the city's North Side, full of historic, architecturally inspiring homes and a renowned entertainment district. Ravenswood manages to capture the convenience of the city combined with the charm of a smaller town. With everything from a neighborhood-wide garage sale to a local art walk, this neighborhood cultivates a community among its residents. Thanks to a very active Chamber of Commerce, neighborhood festivals are scheduled year-round.

It is bounded by the river on the south, the Magnificent Mile portion of Michigan Avenue on the west, and Lake Michigan on the north and east, according to most sources, although the City of Chicago only recognizes a small portion of this region as Streeterville. The tourist attraction of Navy Pier extends out into the lake from southern Streeterville. The area contains a combination of hotels, restaurants, professional office centers, residential high-rises, universities, medical facilities, and cultural venues.
